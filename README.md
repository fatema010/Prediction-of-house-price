## Project Details

- **Motivation:** The project is designed to provide accurate predictions of house prices, aiding potential buyers, sellers,
  and real estate professionals in making informed decisions.

- **Notebook:** The core analysis and modeling are documented in the Jupyter Notebook "Notebook.ipynb". This notebook covers data preprocessing,
   exploratory analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

- **Language:** Python

## Dataset

- **Source:** The project uses a dataset containing various features of houses, such as area, location, number of rooms,
   amenities, and more, along with their corresponding prices.

  
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- The initial analysis explores the dataset, identifying trends, correlations, and potential outliers.

- Visualizations provide insights into the distribution of house prices and relationships between features.

## Feature Engineering

- Feature engineering techniques are applied to enhance the model's predictive power.

- New features are created, and existing features may be transformed to capture important patterns.

## Model Selection

- Various machine learning algorithms, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests, are considered.

- The model selection is based on performance metrics, interpretability, and generalization to new data.

## Training and Evaluation

- The chosen model is trained on a training dataset and evaluated on a separate test dataset.

- Evaluation metrics assess model performance, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Results

- The analysis showcases the predictive capabilities of the house price prediction model.

- Interpretability of the model's predictions is highlighted, allowing users to understand the influence of different features on house prices.
